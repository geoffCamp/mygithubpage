                <p>
                    I got my first taste of programing while enrolled in the Biological Engineering program at the University of Guelph. I continued to dabble
                    in code throughout my studies and while working in Quality Engineering post graduation. After a brief, six month stint in manufacturing, I
                    decided to answer my true calling; in 2014 I returned to UoG in the Bachelor of Computing program.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did extensive C programming thoughout my Computing degree and was also introduced to object oriented concepts via Java. I was able to leverage that
                    experience while creating the WeatherWare Android application and further while developing the Yumr platform for both Android and iOS. Aside from mobile
                    development, I am also an adequate full stack web developer having completed two social web applications and a number of freelance website projects.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goals for the near future are split between two different paths. I'm looking to either dive deeper into the world of software, becoming familiar with 
                    backend architecture; or to take a step back from programming and apply my coding skills to a more physical project such as mechatronics engineering. I
                    find both directions to be equally intriguing and look forward to investigating them further as opportunities present themselves.
